                    We&#39;ve gone as far as 100 miles out of our way to play for events. Depending on the time of year, our schedule, and other variables, in most cases we can work something for long distance requests.

                <h3 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q2">Will you collaborate with other musicians?
                </h3>
                <div id="q2" class="collapse ">
                    For really special occassions such as weddings, we do try to team up with other musicians that our customers want for their event. For the extra practices and consultations we do add an extra fee that varies based on the circumstances.
                </div>
                <h3 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3">Is there a cancelation deadling or fee?</h3>
                <div id="q3" class="collapse ">
                    We do like to know at least 3 weeks in advance if our customers are going to cancel, and there may be a fee for canceling up to 2 days before the event.
                </div>
                <h3 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4">How much can I expect to pay for your services?</h3>
                <div id="q4" class="collapse ">
                    Our prices can range from under $100 to over $1000 and is based on many variables such as event type, number of musicians, travel distance and other things. We work with our customers on a personal basis to provide the custom services that meet their unique needs.

                <h3 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5">Do you perform requested songs?</h3>
                <div id="q5" class="collapse ">
                   Yes! Our team thoroughly enjoys making new arrangments and learing new music. However, we like to know well ahead of time if you would like to request a peice that we've never played before.
                </div>
                <h3 class="btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6">Do you attened wedding rehearsals?</h3>
                <div id="q6" class="collapse ">
                   Most of our wedding customers do like to have the music played at the rehersal and we do our best to make that possible in most cases, although there is an added fee for doing so. For relatively distant weddings however, we may not offer that service.
