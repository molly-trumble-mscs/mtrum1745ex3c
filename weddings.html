                <h2>The Prelude &amp; Postlude</h2>
                <p>
                    The Prelude and postlude is played as background music before and after the ceremony as the guests arrive and leave. Some preludes start as early as 45 minutes to and hour beforehand, but 30 minutes is usually plenty in most cases. Calm pieces are the usual choice for the prelude and more peppy ones for the postlude.</p>

                <h2>Entrance of Relatives</h2>
                <p>
                    The entrance of the relatives - usually the parents or families of the couple - signal the start of the ceremony. The music played here can be the same as the bridal party or it can be a separate piece.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4"">
                <h2>Bridal Party Entrance</h2>
                <p>
                    This is when the bridsmades, groomsmen, flower girls, or whoever is in the bridal party makes their way down the isle. Depending on the size of the party, their may be enough time to do several pieces or play the same one multiple times. For traditional weddings, Jesu Joy or Canon in D are frequently played.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>The Grand Entrance</h2>
                <p>
                    The climax of the entire proccessional is when the bride comes in. The music played here is generally more majestic than previously. In some weddings the music continues from the bridal party entrance, but in other cases there is a slight pause, and then another peice is played. Common choices range from classical wedding marches to modern movie soundtracks.

                <h2>The Ceremony</h2>
                <p>
                    There is usally some kind of break in the middle of the ceremony when the couple pours sand or lights a unity candle while music is played in the background. This can be a good time for a special song expressing your sincerety to each other. We have done some unique arrangments for many couples and can help you find something for this part of the ceremony.</p>

                <h2>The Recessional</h2>
                <p>
                    The couple is announced as married and its time for the whole party to make their exits. As the pary walks back down the isle, some upbeat music is enthusiastically performed to celebrate the newly wedded couple. There are many peices available that are most appropriate for the joyous recessional.</p>
